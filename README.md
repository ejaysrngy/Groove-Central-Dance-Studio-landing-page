# Groove Central Dance Studio - landing page

https://ejaysrngy.github.io/Groove-Central-Dance-Studio-landing-page/

The following project is our capstone project for The Coding School Web Dev Bootcamp. 
We were tasked to make a any website of your choice from scratch.
The web page is about a dance studio, namely, Groove Central Dance Studio, which is a local dance studio here in Manila.

The web page is solely front-end (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery) since that was the main focus of the 5-week bootcamp from TCS.
It showcases choreographers and some recitals of some dance teams in the Philippines.
There aren't that much clickable links, but as I go along with learning Web Dev, I may add more features and hopefully some backend features.
